# UW-Madison-CS300-Program-4

Introduction

In this program, we are going to provide you with a source code for P3 developed by one of the CS300 teams. This code is similar to the one you have already submitted for P3. You may have noticed that your program developed so far for the Book Library application is not robust. It crashes in case of bad input provided by the user (for instance user command with incorrect syntax). We are going to handle all these erroneous input. We are also going to load books to the books Arraylist of a library from a file and save its content to a file too. Your program will also need to account for a variety of potential problems with the data in this file, and report appropriate warning messages for each.
